Due to capacity constraints on github, we uploaded AnythingNER to our huggingface. Please use the [link](https://huggingface.co/CascadeNER/models_for_CascadeNER/tree/main) to download it and put it into here.

We provide our code of dynamic categorization and scripts for data format transformation (GEIC-to-BIO, GEIC-to-SWIFT) in this repo.
