We provide our code of dynamic categorization and scripts for data format transformation (GEIC-to-BIO, GEIC-to-SWIFT) in this repo.

If you want to try dynamic categorization on your own dataset or just evaluate your dataset, please use main.py or metric.py in catgorization file.

Other datasets in GEIC and SWIFT format are provided in our HuggingFace. Please use the [link](https://huggingface.co/CascadeNER/models_for_CascadeNER/tree/main) to download it.
